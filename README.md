# ðŸ“Š Numerical Methods for Solving ODEs

This repository provides python implementations of various numerical methods for solving **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**.

## ðŸš€ Implemented Methods

The following numerical methods are included:

- **Euler Method**
- **Euler-Richardson Method**
- **Trapezoidal Method**
- **Adams-Bashforth Methods** (2nd and 3rd order)
- **Adams-Moulton Methods** (2nd and 3rd order)
- **Runge-Kutta Methods** (2nd, 3rd, and 4th order)

Each method is implemented with clarity and can be used for educational purposes or integrated into larger computational systems.
